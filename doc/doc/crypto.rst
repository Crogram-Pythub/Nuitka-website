 Buying Nuitka with Crypto currency
####################################

*********************
 Accepted currencies
*********************

You can pay with Bitcoin transfers and 2 forms of USDT, a stable coin.
These shall be done to our wallet addresses as listed below.

Prices should match what e.g. ``400 EUR in USDT`` or ``400 EUR in BTC``
gives in Google. Notice that the full package is the minimal version
sold via Crypto due to the handling overhead.

******************

******************

There are different forms of USDT, a currency that has equality with the
USD. You can transfer to each of these 4 different flavors of USDT.

 Factory Instructions
######################

*******************
 Factory Rationale
*******************

Both the ``main`` and ``develop`` branch are supposed to be working for
people at all times. For experiments in the context of issues and
generally features not yet ready for prime time, there we have the
factory branch.

You have probably come here, because you were asked to checkout a change
made for you on ``factory``.

************************
 How to get ``factory``
************************

|Factory Status|

git
===

.. code:: bash

   git clone --branch factory https://github.com/Nuitka/Nuitka.git

pip
===

.. code:: bash

   pip install -U --force-reinstall "https://github.com/Nuitka/Nuitka/archive/factory.zip"

**********************
 When it is released?
**********************

Factory gets distributed to main and develop when I think the time has
come to make a new hotfix. Usually there is one every one or two weeks,
but before a new release comes out, they often stop for a while, with
the new release being so close it wouldn't matter much.

Fixes that are not invasive go to a hotfix branch on GitHub first, you
can use that branch if you want. Fixes that are invasive go to develop
at roughly the same time a hotfix is releases, there is usually a day
between that for package builds to be completed.

For invasive fixes that are critical, they might be release triggers,
certainly if Nuitka commercial priority customers are affected.

*****************
 Word of Warning
*****************

This personal branch may include all kinds of stupid mistakes, e.g. not
being executable with all versions, crashing, not working at all. They
also frequently change without notice. So please use it only for the
issue at hand or even more than usually on your own risk.

Once confirmed and found good, fixes will normally appear on develop or
main branch relatively shortly, try to use those instead from then on,
and wait for the change to appear there. To keep using factory is asking
for trouble, and it may have issues you didn't notice.

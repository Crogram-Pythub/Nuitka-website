############################

****************
 What is Nuitka
****************

Nuitka is the optimizing Python compiler written in Python that creates
executables that run without an need for a separate installer. Data
files can both be included or put alongside.

Nuitka is fully compatible with |SUPPORTED_PYTHONS|, works on Windows,
macOS, Linux and more, basically where Python works for you already.

Nuitka Standard
===============

The standard edition bundles your code, dependencies and data into a
single executable if you want. It also does acceleration, just running
faster in the same environment, and can produce extension modules as
well. It is freely distributed under the Apache license.

Nuitka Commercial
=================

The commercial edition additionally protects your code, data and
outputs, so that users of the executable cannot access these. This a
private repository of plugins that you pay to get access to.
Additionally, you can purchase priority support.

Nuitka is an effort, mainly driven in my spare time. For travels to
Python conferences, web site costs, etc. I am accepting donations via
PayPal. The money received will be used to sponsor Nuitka development.

Alternatively Bitcoin and UST transfers are also great for supporting
the standard Nuitka project. There are different forms of USDT, a
currency that has equality with the USD. You can transfer to each of
these 4 different flavors of USDT.
